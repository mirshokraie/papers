Developers often test their web applications using frameworks such
as Selenium. 
Although such frameworks help to automate test execution, the test cases need to be written manually, which is tedious and inefficient.
Current web test generation techniques suffer from two shortcomings; they (1) merely target the generation of event sequences, (2) either ignore the oracle problem or simplify it through generic soft oracles such as HTML validation and runtime exceptions. We present a framework to automatically generate
regression test cases at two complementary levels: (1) individual \javascript  
functions, (2) DOM event sequences. These test cases are strengthened by
automatically generated mutation-based oracles. % capable of detecting regression faults in \javascript code and the DOM. 
We empirically evaluate the implementation of our approach, called \tool, to assess its efficacy. 
The results on thirteen \javascript-based applications show that the generated test cases achieve a coverage of 68.4\% and that \tool can detect injected \javascript and DOM faults with a high accuracy (100\% precision, 70\% recall).
We also find that \tool outperforms an existing \javascript test automation framework both in terms of coverage and detected faults.
%Testing JavaScript-based applications is challenging as manually exploring various execution paths of the application is difficult.
%Also JavaScript's highly dynamic nature as well as its complex interaction with the DOM make it difficult for the tester to achieve high coverage. 

%In current practice of \javascript testing, developers often write test cases manually using unit testing frameworks such as Selenium. While such tools help testers to design a test suite by providing an environment to record GUI actions, \javascript testing still remains a challenging task as manually exploring various execution paths of the application is difficult. Even after detecting an incorrect behaviour of the application, \javascript's highly dynamic nature as well as its complex interaction with Document Object Model (DOM) make it difficult for the tester to achieve high coverage. In this paper, we present a framework to automatically generate unit tests for web applications at two levels: (1) individual \javascript functions, (2) DOM event sequences. These  test cases are strengthened by automatically generated mutation-based oracles capable of detecting faults in \javascript code as well as the DOM tree. We implement our approach in a tool called \tool. We empirically evaluate \tool, by comparing it to another existing \javascript test generator, to assess its efficacy in terms of achieved coverage by the generated test suite as well as fault finding capability.
