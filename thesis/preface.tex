\chapter{Preface}
During my PhD studies, I have conducted the research described in this dissertation in collaboration with my supervisors, Ali Mesbah and Karthik Pattabiraman at the University of British Columbia (UBC). 
Research projects included in this dissertation have been either published or under preparation for submission. I was the main contributor for the research projects presented in each chapter, including the initial idea, developing, and evaluating the system. I had the collaboration of Ali Mesbah and Karthik Pattabiraman to discuss the projects and ideas, as well as making edits in the text.
