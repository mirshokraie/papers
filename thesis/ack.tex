\chapter{Acknowledgments}
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my senior supervisor, Ali Mesbah,
for mentoring me in the past four years with his patience and knowledge. Without his support, completion of this thesis would not have been possible for me.
I would also like to thank Karthik Pattabiraman for the enriching feedback he provided during the conversations we had. The knowledge that I have gained through the insightful
discussions with Karthik are invaluable.

I am grateful to all the members at the Software Analysis and Testing Lab for providing me a stimulating and fun environment. 
A special thank to my amazing wonderful friend Maryam for helping me get through the difficult times, and for all the emotional and caring support she provided.
Last but certainly not least, I owe my deepest gratitude to my
parents for their love and endless support. I deeply appreciate the never-ending patience I have received from them.
