\section{Motivation} \label{Sec:motivation}

Unlike DOM-based testing, asserting the behaviour of a \javascript application through unit-level tests requires a tester to check the correctness of several intermediate code-level variables and object properties. The code-level operations are mainly responsible for updating the DOM during the application execution. Therefore, a tester needs to analyze the relationship between the \javascript code and the DOM's evolution. 
%Moreover, in order to prevent generating fragile unit tests, the testing effort should be directed towards aspects of the system behavior that are relevant to important DOM changes. 
We believe that DOM-based assertions can be utilized as a guideline to generate unit test assertions at \javascript code level. In this section, we discuss why through an example.

\figref{example} presents (a) snippet of a \javascript-based shopping cart application, and (b) sample DOM-based \selenium test case, which  we will use as a running example. The application's code (a) consists of two functions:
\begin{enumerate}

\item \code{addToCart} is bound to the event handler of DOM element with class attribute \code{merchandise}. When any of these element are clicked, \code{addToCa\-rt} gets the information of the selected merchandise, and sets the quantity of the current available items by updating the \code{availItems} object. If a valid discount coupon exists, \code{addToCart} calculates the discount value, and disables the selected  coupon button with ID \code{couponButt} by removing the corresponding class. 
Finally, \code{addToCart} updates the payable amount by setting the \code{payable} property of the \code{customer} object.

\item \code{viewCart} is invoked by clicking on a DOM element with ID \code{shopCart}. The function appends a message to a \code{div} element with class \code{shopConta\-iner} including the final payable amount of the customer. If the  coupon button with ID \code{couponButt} is not selected and the payable amount is equal to zero, then the empty cart message is shown.    

\end{enumerate}
%\figref{domTest} shows a sample DOM-based \selenium test case written for the running example. 
Let's assume that in line 14 of \figref{example}(a) \code{selItem.price}, which represents the original price of the merchandise, is 100, and \code{selItem.quantity} is 1. In line 18, the discount, which is calculated based on the \code{data} value of the \code{couponButt} element is 30. 
The DOM-based assertion in \figref{example}(b) (line 11) checks the correctness of a text appended to a \code{div} element with class \code{shopContainer} containing the final amount payable by the customer, which is equal to 70 in this example.
Analyzing the assertion in line 11 of \figref{example}(b) indicates that the expected value of the assertion is directly influenced by the \code{payable} property of \code{customer} object as well as the object's property \code{coupon.expired} in function \code{addToCart}. We also infer that the \code{selitem} variable in line 9 of \figref{example}(a), which directly influences the value of \code{customer.payable}, is also used in updating the value of \code{availItems.count} in line 12.

Further, by leveraging the execution information obtained from running the DOM-based test case, we can infer the DOM's evolution, which can influence the fault finding capability of the test suite. However, this is not checked by the DOM-based test suite.
For instance, DOM element with ID \code{couponButt} is accessed several times in function \code{addToCart} as well as \code{viewCart} as the test case in \figref{example}(b) runs, however it remains unchecked. Since the evolution of the \code{couponButt} DOM element pertains to the underlying \javascript code, it is important to assert on code statements responsible for changing the aforementioned DOM elements.             

%an expected value oracle for the given test input, confident
%that their effort is directed towards aspects of the system
%behavior that are relevant to important dom changes and thus not fragile
%
%easy to write DOM test and assert the final behaviour--difficult to write unit test and assert many intermediate behaviours that are also relevant to the final output. DOM-based tester may also miss some other important DOM-based behaviours to check.
%
%we can get more info from the sequence of events used in the dom-based test as the basis line of execution test + the dom-based assertion: from sequence we can infer missed dom checks. from dom-based assertion we can infer intermediate behaviours that are directly focused on the dom-based assertion + the rest of program points that are influenced by the assertion. this gives us an important set of oracles which falls in the neighbourhood area of the assertion, plus some important other oracles which are out of this neighbourhood zone but still important.
