\section{Tool Implementation: \mutandis} \label{Sec:tool}

We have implemented our \javascript mutation testing approach in a tool called \mutandis. \mutandis is written in Java and is publicly available for download.\footnoteremember{mutandisDownload}{\url{https://github.com/saltlab/mutandis/}}

To infer \javascript dynamic invariants, we use our recently developed tool, \jsart \cite{mirshokraie:icwe12}.
For \javascript code interception, we employ a proxy between the client and the server. 
This enables us to automatically analyze the content of HTTP responses before they reach the browser. To instrument or mutate the intercepted code, Mozilla Rhino\curl{http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/} is used to parse \javascript code to an AST, and back to the source code after the instrumentation or mutation is performed.
The execution trace profiler is able to collect trace data from the instrumented application code by exercising the web application under test through one of the following methods: (1) exhaustive automatic crawling using \crawljax \cite{mesbah:tweb11},  (2) the execution of existing test cases, or (3) a combination of crawling and test suite execution.
