\chapter{JavaScript Mutation Testing} \label{Chap:mutandis}
In response to our second research question (RQ 1.3.B), we propose \cite{mirshokraie:tse15, mirshokraie:icst13} a generic mutation testing approach that guides the mutation generation process towards effective mutations that (1) affect error-prone sections of the program, (2) impact the program's behaviour and as such are potentially non-equivalent. In our work, \emph{effectiveness} is defined in terms of the severity of the impact of a single generated mutation on the applications observable behaviour.  %such that the mutations are not trivial as well as being non-equivalent.
Our technique leverages static as well as dynamic program data to rank, select, and mutate potentially behaviour-affecting portions of the program code. %(i.e., functions, branches, variables).

Our mutation testing approach is generic and can be applied to any programming language. However, in this work, we implement our technique for \javascript. In particular, we propose a set of \javascript specific mutation operators, capturing  common  \javascript programmer mistakes. \javascript is widely used in modern web applications, which often consist of thousands of lines of \javascript code, and is critical to their functionality.

Our results show that, on average,  93\% of the mutants generated by \mutandis are non-equivalent.
Further, the mutations generated have a high bug severity rank, and are capable of
identifying shortcomings in existing \javascript test suites. 
While the aim of this work is not particularly generating hard-to-kill mutants, our experimental results indicate that the guided approach does not adversely influence the stubbornness of the generated mutants.
