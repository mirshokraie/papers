\section{Conclusions}
\label{Sec:conclusion}
%\javascript is playing a prominent role in modern Web 2.0 applications. Due to its loosely typed and dynamic nature, the language is known to be error-prone and difficult to test.
In this work, we present an automated technique for \javascript regression testing based on 
generated invariant assertions. The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item A method for detecting \javascript invariants across multiple application executions
through on-the-fly \javascript instrumentation and tracing of program variables and DOM manipulations;
\item A technique for automatically converting the inferred invariants into stable assertions,
and injecting them back into the web application for regression testing;
\item The implementation of our proposed technique in an open source
tool called \jsart;
\item An empirical study on nine open source \javascript applications. The results of our study show that our tool is able to effectively infer stable assertions and 
detect regression faults with minimal performance overhead;
\end{itemize}
%Our future work encompasses conducting more case studies to generalize the findings as well as extending the current \javascript DOM modifications detector so that it is capable of coping with more patterns in other \javascript libraries. In addition, we will explore ways of fully automating the navigation part by generating crawling specifications.
