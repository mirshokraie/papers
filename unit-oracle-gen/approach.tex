\section{Approach} \label{Sec:approach}
At high level, our approach generates function level assertions for the \javascript code by utilizing human written DOM-based tests and assertions. Our code level assertions fall in the following three categories: (1) explicit assertions, which are directly inferred from analyzing the manually written DOM-based assertions, (2) implicit assertions, which are indirectly connected to human written DOM-based assertions, and (3) potential candidate assertions, which are not included in the written DOM-based assertions, yet are potentially useful to be checked by the function level test suite. We discuss each of the aforementioned categories in the following subsections in more details.
