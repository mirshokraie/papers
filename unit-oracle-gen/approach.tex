\figref{approachDiagram} shows an overview of our unit-level assertion generation technique.
At a high level, our approach generates code-level assertions based on human written DOM-based tests and assertions. Our code level assertions fall in the following three categories: (1) explicit assertions, which are directly inferred from analyzing the manually written DOM-based assertions, (2) implicit assertions, which are indirectly inferred from the human written DOM-based assertions, and (3) candidate assertions, which are not considered in the written DOM-based assertions, yet are potentially useful for fault detection. We describe how our approach below finds the three categories of assertions. The numbers below in parentheses correspond to those in the boxes of \figref{approachDiagram}.

In our approach we (1) execute the instrumented application by running the existing DOM-based test suite, and gather the execution trace of the application. We then extract (2) DOM-based assertions, which are executed as the test suite runs, and (3) candidate DOM element properties, which are useful DOM properties that can be used to generate assertions. We also (4) identify the initial point of connection between the application's source code and checked DOM element.
%We collect lines of code responsible for updating the corresponding DOM element. 
%We determine DOM mutating statements, 

We use the information gathered during the test suite execution to obtain the assertions. We (5) calculate the backward slice of the DOM mutating statements to find the entire code blocks that update the checked DOM element, (6) extract accessible entities from the obtained statements, and (7) form explicit assertions using the accessible entries. 
We further (8) perform a forward slice on the extracted entities to identify statements that are implicitly affected by such entities, and (9) form implicit assertions using the collected entities, and (10) generate candidate assertions by performing steps (4), (5), and (6) on the inferred candidate DOM element properties (3).

Our overall unit-level assertion generation is presented in \algref{algorithm}. In the following sections we describe our technique for extracting DOM related information from the execution (\secref{extractDomRelatedInfo}), relating
DOM mutations to the \javascript code (\secref{domToCode}), and generating unit test assertions (\secref{unitLevelAssertion}).
