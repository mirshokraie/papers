\section{Empirical Evaluation} \label{Sec:evaluation}
To quantitatively assess the efficacy of our test generation approach, we have conducted a case study, in which we address the following research questions:

\begin{description}[noitemsep]
\item [RQ1] Is \tool more effective than DOM-based assertions written manually by the tester in terms of fault finding capability?
\item [RQ2] How accurate is our tool in mapping DOM-related changes to the corresponding \javascript code?
\item [RQ3] How does \tool compare to the existing mutation-based approach for identifying unit test assertions?
\end{description}

\tool and the experimental data are available for download \cite{atrina-dl}.

\subsection{Objects}
Our study includes four open source \javascript web applications that have \selenium test cases. \tabref{objectsTable} presents the experimental objects and their properties. Phormer \cite{phormer} is a photo gallery web application. EnterpriseStore \cite{enterpriseStore} is an asset management web application. WolfCMS \cite{wolfcms} is a content management system, and Claroline \cite{claroline} is a collaborative online learning and course management system.
