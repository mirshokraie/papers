\section{Conclusions} \label{Sec:concs}
In this paper, we presented an automated technique to generate \javascript unit test assertions; given  a web application and a UI-level test suite, we generate assertions that can capture regression faults in the \javascript code. We implemented our approach in an open-source tool called \tool. We empirically evaluated \tool on seven web applications. The results show that our approach (1) is accurate in mapping the existing UI-level assertions to the \javascript code, (2) is effective in detecting regression faults (63\% on average), (3) outperforms human-written DOM-based assertions in terms of fault finding capability (by 31\% on average), and (4) generates unit assertions that are more effective (26\% on average) than those produced by a mutation-based technique.

The results indicate that existing higher level test assertions can be leveraged to generate unit-level assertions. In our current approach we rely on parts of the code that are covered by the human-written test cases. Our future work will include using learning-based techniques to generate unit-level assertions for parts of the code that are not examined through existing human-written tests.
