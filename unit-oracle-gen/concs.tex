\section{Conclusions} \label{Sec:concs}
In this paper, we present an automated technique to generate unit-level assertions for the \javascript code. Given (1) a web application that highly interact with the DOM through the underlying \javascript code, and (2) a DOM-based test suite, we make use of the human-written DOM-based test cases to generate effective assertions that can capture regression faults in the \javascript code. We implemented our approach in an open-source tool called \tool. We empirically evaluated \tool on seven web applications. The results show that our approach (1) is accurate in mapping the assertions to the\javascript code, (2) is effective in detecting injected regression faults (63\% on average), (3) outperforms human-written DOM-based assertions in terms of fault finding capability by 31\% on average, and (4) generates unit assertions that are more effective (26\% on average) than those produced by mutation-based technique.

The results indicate that existing DOM-based test assertions can be leveraged to generate unit-level assertions, however, in our current approach we rely on parts of the code that are covered by the human-written test cases. Our future work will include using learning-based techniques to generate unit-level assertions for parts of the code, that are not examined through existing human-written tests.
