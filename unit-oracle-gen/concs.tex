\section{Conclusions} \label{Sec:concs}
In this paper, we present an automated technique to generate unit-level assertions for the \javascript code. Given (1) a web application that highly interact with the DOM through the underlying \javascript code, and (2) a DOM-based test suite, we make use of the human-written DOM-based test cases to generate effective assertions that can capture regression faults in the \javascript code. We implemented our approach in an open-source tool called \tool. We empirically evaluated \tool on four web applications. The results show that our approach (1) is accurate in mapping the assertions to the\javascript code, (2) is effective in detecting injected regression faults (62\% on average), (3) outperforms human-written DOM-based assertions in terms of fault finding capability by 37\% on average, and (4) generates unit assertions that are more effective (29\% on average) than those produced by mutation-based technique.
