\subsection{Generating Unit-Level Assertions} \label{Sec:unitLevelAssertion}
Our approach targets postcondition assertions which are used to examine the expected behaviour of a given function after it is executed in a unit test case.
Through analyzing a given DOM-based test case, we generate unit-level assertions in the following three categories: (1) assertions, which are directly related to a given DOM-based assertion, (2) assertions, which are indirectly affected by a given DOM-based assertion, and (3) assertions that have direct impact on important DOM elements which are not checked by the existing DOM-based assertions. In the following we explain each category in details.
