\subsection{Threats to Validity} \label{Sec:threatsToValidity}
An external threat to the validity of our evaluation is the limited number of \javascript applications used to measure the effectiveness of our approach. We mitigated this threat by using web applications from various domains, code size, and functionality. Another threat concerns validating failed assertions through manual inspection that can be error-prone. To mitigate this threat, we carefully examine the code in which the assertion failed to make sure that the injected fault was responsible for the assertion failure. Moreover, manual computation of the \javascript slices to measure precision and recall is a time intensive task done by the authors of the paper, and thus we acknowledge that it could be error-prone, although we made every effort to mitigate this threat by precisely examining the application's code.

The regression faults we inject to evaluate the effectiveness of \tool may not be realistic. We mitigate this threat by injecting mutations that represent common \javascript applications faults, as well as using real-world web applications, and test cases written by other developers.
