\subsection{Extracting DOM-Related Features} \label{Sec:extractDomRelatedInfo}
The DOM connects a test case to the web application's \javascript code. Therefore, we first need to analyze the DOM-based test suite and extract the following pieces of information: (1) DOM-related operations of the existing test suite that may have tight connection with the \javascript code, and (2) accessed DOM properties, which are potentially important from the application's point of view, however, they are left unchecked in the manually-written test suite. In the following we describe each in details.
